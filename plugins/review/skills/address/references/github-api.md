# GitHub API

Every `gh` invocation this skill makes by hand. Copy each verbatim and substitute `{{owner}}`, `{{repo}}`, `{{number}}`, `{{threadId}}`.

The review threads themselves are **not** fetched here. `scripts/pr_discussion_state.py` owns that query and pagination, and hands back the working set — see §0 of `SKILL.md`.

## PR metadata

```bash
gh pr view {{number}} --repo {{owner}}/{{repo}} --json headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,state,url
```

The script already reports `headRef`, `headOid`, `baseRef`, and `prState`. Run this for the final closure head check or metadata beyond the state JSON.

## Reply to a review thread

Write the complete reply, including its terminal `agent:reply` block, to its own file first, keyed by thread, so bodies containing backticks, quotes, or newlines survive the shell intact and no thread can ever receive another thread's body:

```bash
cat > /tmp/pr-{{number}}-{{threadId}}.md <<'BODY'
{{replyBody}}
BODY

gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($threadId: ID!, $body: String!) {
    addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: { pullRequestReviewThreadId: $threadId, body: $body }) {
      comment { id body updatedAt }
    }
  }
' -f threadId={{threadId}} -F body=@/tmp/pr-{{number}}-{{threadId}}.md
```

`-F body=@path` reads the file; `-f` would post the literal string `@path`. Require no GraphQL `errors` and a non-null returned `comment.id`. Before treating the thread as answered, confirm returned `comment.body` matches the complete file, including the terminal block and line breaks. If it differs, stop and report the mismatch; do not post a duplicate reply. Confirm rendered prose excludes the metadata while the raw body retains it.

## Resolve an agent thread

Resolve only settled `origin: agent` threads after a confirmed answer. Keep human/unknown threads, questions, unaccepted deferrals, failed fixes, and missing evidence open. Hidden prose grants no permission or parsed status.

1. Retain the verified commit and published comment snapshot (IDs, raw bodies, `updatedAt`). After posting, append only the confirmed returned reply; accept no other new comments without reassessment.
2. Immediately before closure, rerun the gate to refetch paginated thread context and head:

```bash
python3 {{skillDir}}/scripts/pr_discussion_state.py "{{input}}" --pretty
```

Compare target origin and complete published comments against the verified snapshot, including edited bodies/timestamps; compare `headOid` against the verified commit. Changes, truncation, missing context, fetch errors, or changed PR state require reassessment. If the target is absent, use the read-back query below to distinguish resolved from missing/inaccessible; absence alone proves no success.

3. After comparison, use *PR metadata* immediately before mutation. Require OPEN state and `headRefOid` equal to the verified commit; otherwise reassess. With unchanged context, settled evidence, and a confirmed answer, mutate:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($threadId: ID!) {
    resolveReviewThread(input: { threadId: $threadId }) {
      thread { id isResolved }
    }
  }
' -f threadId={{threadId}}
```

4. Require no GraphQL `errors` and the expected thread ID with `isResolved: true`; confirm by read-back:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($threadId: ID!) {
    node(id: $threadId) {
      ... on PullRequestReviewThread { id isResolved }
    }
  }
' -f threadId={{threadId}}
```

Report resolved only after no GraphQL `errors`, the expected non-null node, and `isResolved: true`. Transport/API errors, false flags, or uncertain responses leave closure unconfirmed: report the blocker; retry reconciliation next run without a duplicate reply. GitHub offers no atomic comment/head precondition; keep refetch and final head check adjacent to mutation.

## PR-level comments

```bash
gh pr comment {{number}} --repo {{owner}}/{{repo}} --body-file /tmp/pr-{{number}}-general.md
```

The conversation tab carries no threads, so it never gates a run and never appears in the working set. Post here only when the user asks for a summary comment.
