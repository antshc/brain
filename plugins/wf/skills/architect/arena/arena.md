# Arena

Synthesis procedure of the `architect` skill. Paths resolve from the skill base directory.

Open a todolist with one entry per phase (Frame, Fan out, Cross-judge, Pick, Graft, Verify) before launching anything.

## Phase A: Frame

Every candidate gets the same prompt, so the prompt is the contract.

1. State the artifact each candidate is producing.
2. Derive the rubric, 3-6 concrete gradeable criteria for what success looks like on *this* task. It is the picker's tool in Phase D. Candidates only see the task.
3. Pick the runners. Use the runner role the caller names in `models.md`. If the value is missing, use its fallback, one runner per entry. An `auto` or `inherit-parent` entry in this line means the parent model, so omit `model` for it. If the subagent tool rejects a configured entry, run that seat on its family's fallback entry and say so. Families go by prefix: `claude-*`, `mai-*`, `gpt-*`, `gemini-*`. If the family has no fallback entry, or the subagent tool rejects it, use the closest valid model of the same family from its error message, or drop the seat and say so when there is none. If dropped seats leave fewer than two runners, add runners until there are two, or one when the line has one entry. Run each added runner on a remaining runner's model, or omit `model` so it runs on the parent model when none remain, and say so. Spawn more runners when the arena covers multiple design directions. Use the same model N times when the work is generation-bound rather than judgment-sensitive. Pick each subagent's reasoning effort per `references/subagents.md`.
4. Give each candidate its own output location (a git worktree where possible, otherwise `<repo-root>/tmp/architect-<slug>/arena/candidate-<n>/` per *Artifact location* in `SKILL.md`), per *Separate before serializing shared state* in `references/principles.md`.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N subagents in one message with `mode: "background"`, each with the task, the path to the shared grounding, its own output path, and instructions to produce the artifact and a short rationale naming the alternatives it considered and what it rejected.

If a candidate produces no output, proceed with N-1 and note the dropout.

## Phase C: Cross-judge

After all Phase B candidates complete, choose one model from the `arena cross-judge pool` role in `models.md`. If the value is missing, choose from its fallback. Spawn one read-only judge subagent (`explore`). The judge is never from the parent's family, as Phase A step 3 defines families. Try only the entries from another family, in pool order. An `auto` or `inherit-parent` entry is the parent model, so it never judges. With the fallback pool, a Claude parent gets `grok-4.7 xhigh`. A parent from any other family gets `claude-opus-5.5 xhigh` first. If the subagent tool rejects an entry, use a valid effort of the same model at the closest level from the error message, or move to the next entry when there is none. If no entry from another family runs, try the fallback pool's entries from another family the same way. If none of those runs, skip the judge, pick the base alone in Phase D, and say so. If you do not know the parent's model, try the pool's real slugs in pool order and say that the family check did not run. The judge sees the rubric and the candidates by path label, scores each criterion, and recommends a base with rationale. It runs in parallel with your reading in Phase D. Don't spawn it while candidates are still writing.

## Phase D: Pick a base

Read every candidate end to end before picking. Score each against the rubric criterion by criterion, not on holistic feel, and compare with the cross-judge when Phase C ran one. Agreement on the base confirms the pick. Disagreement means one of you is biased or the rubric was ambiguous. Read both rationales before deciding.

Pick the base a future maintainer can extend most easily without breaking invariants. When two feel tied, prefer the cleaner boundary or smaller API, per *Laziness protocol* in `references/principles.md`.

## Phase E: Graft

Walk each losing candidate once more for what is worth porting into the base, usually one or two things per candidate, not most of it. Fold each graft in by hand, per *Redesign from first principles* in `references/principles.md`, so the result stays coherent under one mental model. Don't paste mechanically.

If the candidates converge on one shape, that is strong agreement. Note it and ship the consensus shape. No graft is needed. If they wildly diverge, Phase A was under-specified. Reframe and re-run rather than averaging the divergence.

## Phase F: Verify

Verify the synthesized artifact like any other output, per *Prove it works* in `references/principles.md`. If verification finds a problem the arena missed, either Phase A was wrong (re-frame and re-run) or a candidate caught it and you missed the graft (go back to Phase E). Don't paper over it.

## Outputs

One synthesized artifact, with a short synthesis note alongside naming the base and why, the cross-judge's verdict or that Phase C skipped the judge, each graft with its source candidate, what was rejected and why, any convergence or dropouts, and the verification result.
