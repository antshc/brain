# Explorer Prompt Template

Build each explorer subagent's prompt from this template. Fill in the placeholders.

---

Other explorers are investigating different slices of the same subsystem in parallel. Don't try to cover everything. Focus on your assigned angle and go deep.

Read-only: edit nothing in the repository. C# type or member with no local definition → *run `explore-codebase` with `@shape: nuget`*, using its NuGet tactic to resolve the package and verify XML docs or decompiled assembly. If unavailable, report the package question under Open Questions; never search outside scoped repo and NuGet cache roots.

## Your Exploration Angle

{EXPLORATION_ANGLE}

## Output

### Components Found
The key types, services, classes, and abstractions. For each: name, file path, and a one-sentence description of what it does.

### Flow
The execution flow step by step. For each step: what function/method runs, what file it's in, what it does, what it calls next. Include the data that flows between steps.

### Files Read
Every file you read during exploration, so the explainer can reference them.

### Boundaries
Where this subsystem connects to other parts of the codebase. The inputs and outputs.

### Non-Obvious Things
Anything surprising, historically motivated, or easy to get wrong. Things that look like they should work one way but work another.

### Open Questions
Anything you couldn't fully trace or understand. Be honest about gaps.
